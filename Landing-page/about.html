            <h2>About Lead Tracker</h2>
            <p>Lead Tracker is more than just a project; it's a testament to the power of collaboration and a shared vision. Inspired by the collective passion for efficient lead management and the desire to create a valuable tool, our journey began with a simple idea: to make the process of organizing and following up on leads a seamless experience.</p>
            <h2>Our Story:</h2>
            <p>The spark for Lead Tracker ignited during a late-night brainstorming session. Frustrated by the challenges of managing leads scattered across various platforms, our team, driven by Eseigbe Temple, Okang Etta, and Asunde Osiro, envisioned a solution that would simplify this process. The project was born out of the genuine need to enhance productivity, turning a personal struggle into a shared mission.</p>
            <h2>Timeline:</h2>
            <p>The project's inception marked the beginning of an exciting journey. From conceptualization to development and refinement, each phase carried the enthusiasm of a team dedicated to creating a tool that could truly make a difference. The iterative process, feedback loops, and collaborative efforts culminated in Lead Tracker reaching its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage.</p>   
            <h2>Why Lead Tracker?</h2>
            <p>Lead Tracker isn't just a requirement; it's a passion project. It's an embodiment of our commitment to excellence in software development, showcasing the skills honed at Holberton School. Beyond meeting academic criteria, Lead Tracker represents our dedication to solving real-world challenges and delivering tangible value.</p>
